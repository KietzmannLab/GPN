Official codebase of the Glimpse Prediction Networks.

## Codebase map
1. The figures included in the paper can be plotted using [paper_plots.ipynb](paper_plots.ipynb) and [gpn_analysis.ipynb](gpn_analysis.ipynb).

## Requirements

### Importing pretrained networks and analysis data
1. Download the 'logs' folder from [OSF]() and place it under [train/](train/)
2. Download 'saved_actvs' and 'rdms' from [OSF]() and place them at the same level as the figure plotting scripts before executing them.
